# A-Global-Analysis-of-Income-Inequality-2010-2021-
A project submitted to Google Cloud Data Analytics scholarship by Mentor Me Collective; UN SDG Goal: 10: Reduced Inequality

## Introduction
Income inequality remains one of the most pressing socio-economic challenges of our time, acting as a significant barrier to sustainable development, social cohesion, and economic prosperity. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Goal 10 explicitly targets reducing inequality within and among countries. This project undertakes a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of global income inequality trends from 2010 to 2021. The aim is to move beyond anecdotal evidence and provide a quantifiable, granular understanding of the disparities that exist across different geographic and developmental contexts, thereby contributing to the global mission of achieving reduced inequality.

## Problem Identification
The core challenge addressed in this project is the complexity of transforming vast, multidimensional global data into actionable intelligence. While income inequality is widely acknowledged, a precise understanding of its spatial and temporal patterns, its correlation with development metrics, and the disparities that exist within world regions is often lacking. This gap hinders the ability of global organizations, governments, and policymakers to design targeted, evidence-based interventions. Without a clear data-driven foundation, efforts to reduce economic disparities can be misdirected, inefficient, or based on incomplete information.
The specific problem is the need to conduct a comprehensive analysis of income inequality across 194 countries over a 12-year period (2010-2021), to identify the key socio-economic and geographic factors that correlate with inequality levels, and to model the relationship between development and inequality across different world regions.

## Project Aim
To conduct a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of global income inequality trends from 2010 to 2021, identifying key socio-economic and geographic factors that correlate with inequality levels, and to model the relationship between development and inequality across different world regions.

## Project Objectives
To achieve the stated aim, the project was guided by the following specific, measurable objectives:
1.  Quantify and Compare Continental Trends: To analyze key descriptive statistics (mean, median, max, min and range) for income inequality for each continent from 2010 to 2021, identifying regions with the most pronounced and persistent disparities.
2.  Conduct Time-Series Analysis: To uncover significant trends, breakpoints, and patterns of change (upward, downward, or stable) across different continents over the 12-year period.
3.  Investigate Intra-Continental Disparities: To analyze the variation in inequality levels between countries within the same continent and explore correlations with key socioeconomic factors such as Human Development Index (HDI) classification.
4.  Develop an Interactive Dashboard: To create an interactive data visualization dashboard that effectively communicates the spatial and temporal trends in global income inequality, enabling stakeholders to explore the data intuitively.
5.  Synthesize Actionable Recommendations: To translate data-driven insights into actionable recommendations for policymakers, identifying potential intervention points and successful case studies.
